Follow installation instructions for Ogre from the [Ogre Wiki](http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=Installing+the+Ogre+SDK)\r\n  - The 'OGRE_HOME' environment variable is necessary for the project to compile successfully\r\n2. Using CMake, generate a Visual Studio 11 2012 project with native compilers using the project root as the source directory, and a binaries directory of your choosing\r\n3. Open the generated solution (.sln) file in Visual Studio 11 and set **this** project as the startup project\r\n  - By default the startup project is the ALL_BUILD project - this is not what we want\r\n4. Confirm that the project is configured properly by following the instructions [here](http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/Setting+Up+An+Application+-+Visual+Studio#Project_Configuration)\r\n5. At this point, the project should be ready to be modified, built, and run\r\n\r\n### Game Controls\r\n- W            - Forward thrusters\r\n- A            - Left thrusters\r\n- S            - Backward thrusters\r\n- D            - Right thrusters\r\n- Q            - Upward thrusters\r\n- C            - Downward thrusters\r\n- UP           - Pitch up (also mouse up)\r\n- LEFT         - Yaw left (also mouse left)\r\n- DOWN         - Pitch down (also mouse down)\r\n- RIGHT        - Yaw right (also mouse right)\r\n- V            - Roll counter clockwise\r\n- B            - Roll clockwise\r\n- Scroll Wheel - Change camera perspective (scroll in toward first person perspective; scroll out toward third person perspective)\r\n- SPACE        - Fire weapon\r\n- 1            - Switch to laser cannon\r\n- 2            - Switch to plasma cannon\r\n- 3            - Switch to black hole cannon\r\n- Esc          - Exit game\r\n",
